<p>Evolutionary competition between different strategies for dealing with
variable environments:</p>

<p><b>k-snipes:</b> Agents that incorporate a very simple model of
individual learning by prediction error minimization (PEM) in some
agents.  These agents implement one kind of "K-strategy" which, roughly,
prioritizes survival over reproduction.  (I do mean it's a
<em>model</em> of PEM; what these agents do, internally, is much, much
simpler than what's usually meant by PEM.)</p>

<p><b>r-snipes:</b> Agents that don't learn, but produce different types of offspring
that are well suited or poorly suited for survival in different
environments.  These agents implement
one kind of "r-strategy", which roughly prioritize reproduction over
survival.</p>

<p><b>s-snipes:</b> Agents that engage in a simple form of social
learning by copying from nearby agents ("s-snipes").</p>

<p>The point is to compare evolutionary strategies and see which is
selected for under different parameter combinations.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

<b>The two environments:</b> Snipes eat mushrooms.  There are two
environments.  In the <em>east</em> (usually left) environment, small
mushrooms are nutritious (gray-brown-green) and large mushrooms are
poisonous (greenish yellow).  In the <em>west</em> (usually right)
environment, large mushrooms are nutritious (dark gray) and small
mushrooms are poisonous (light gray).

<p><b>Basic snipe behavior:</b> Snipes move randomly within an
environment, gain energy from eating nutritious mushrooms, and lose
energy from eating poisonous mushrooms.  Snipes that accumulate
sufficient energy give birth, and lose energy as a result of the birth.
At birth, each newborn snipe is placed at a random location in a
randomly chosen environment (as if parents temporarily migrated to a new
location to give birth).</p>

<p><b>k-snipes</b> (red circles with pointers) initially eat
mushrooms randomly,  but learn to eat mushrooms whose size signal
(which is normally distributed) indicates that they are probably
nutritious. The direction of a k-snipe's pointer--how far up or down
it is pointing--indicates the degree of the snipe's preference for large
or small mushrooms. </p>

<p><b>r-snipes</b> (blue triangles) never learn.  They produce
offspring that exhibit developmental differences: Roughly half of any
snipe's offspring (upward-pointing triangles) always prefer large
mushrooms; the others (downward-pointing triangles) always prefer
small mushrooms.  Those suited to the environment in which they live
tend to survive and reproduce, and those unsuited to their environment
generally die before reproduction. </p>

<p><b>s-snipes</b> (purple wing shapes) use a social learning or
cultural transmission strategy known as success bias.  A newborn s-snipe
examines nearby snipes and copies the current mushroom size preference
of whatever nearby snipe has the most energy.  If there are no snipes
that are sufficiently near (see the parameter list below), the s-snipe tries
again on the next timestep.  Once an s-snipe adopts a preference, the
preference never changes.  The direction in which an s-snipe points--how
far up or down it is tilted--indicates the degree of the snipe's
preference for large or small mushrooms.</p>

<p><b>Colors:</b> Snipes' energy levels are reflected in their
brightness, with greater brightness indicating more energy.  (This
effect can be subtle.)  The two mushroom colors in each environment
indicate nutritiousness/poisonousness: Lighter colors indicate
nutritiousness--i.e. these mushrooms are energetically favorable to
snipes--while darker colors indicate poisonousness--energetically
unfavorability.  (The fact that the East and West mushrooms have
different hues no functional meaning; it could considered a difference
between mushroom species.) </p>

<p><b>Monitoring individual snipes:</b> If you pause a run, you can
double-click on a snipe to monitor its internal state and watch it move.
It will be circled so that you can keep track of it.  You can use the
Detach button to monitor multiple snipes at the same time.  Then if you
double-click on the little magnifying glass next to energy, for example,
and choose chart, you'll open a plot of that snipe's energy level over
time.</p>

<p><b>Overlapping environment display:</b> It's possible to display both
environments overlapping in the same window, using the "overlapping
subenvs" item on the Displays tab.  Then you can think of snipes that
only eat mushrooms of a given color as having a random developmental
restriction to eating those mushrooms.</p>

<p><b>Command line:</b> You can also run pasta from a command line (see online docs or 
README.md in the full distribution).  In that case, running it with
"--help" will show options for running pasta.</p>

</table>

<p>Some data is reported in other variables in the Model tab:
<table style="width:100%">
<tr><td valign=top>PopsSize</td> <td>Number of snipes in the population (in both environments).</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>KSnipeFreq</td> <td>Relative frequency of k-snipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>RSnipeFreq</td> <td>Relative frequency of r-snipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>SSnipeFreq</td> <td>Relative frequency of s-snipes.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you click on the little magnifying glass next to these
elements, there are additional options that MASON provides for
observing their values.</p>

<p>If you run pasta from the command line, (see online docs or "--help"
will show options for setting the parameters listed above, as well as a
few other options concerning whether to display the GUI concerning
writing data to a file.</p>

<p>There is additional information at

<h3>Things to try:</h3>

Set the number of s-snipes (NumSSnipes) or the number of r-snipes
(NumRSnipes) to zero, so that there is only competition between k-snipes
and one of the other varieties.  Notice that with the default
parameters, k-snipes sometimes increase in frequency early on, but in
the end the r-snipes or s-snipes always increase in frequency at the
expense of k-snipes.  Why?  (Consider monitoring the energy levels of
a few snipes over time.)

<p>Experiment with parameters to see if you can cause k-snipes win the
evolutionary race.  For example, before the start of a k-snipe vs.
r-snipe run, reduce MushNegNutrition.  Does this affects k-snipes'
relative success?  Why?</p>
