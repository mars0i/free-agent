<p>Evolutionary competition between different strategies for dealing with
variable environments:</p>

<p><b>k-snipes:</b> Agents that incorporate a very simple model of
individual learning by prediction error minimization (PEM) in some
agents.  These agents implement one kind of "K-strategy" which, roughly,
prioritizes survival over reproduction.  (I do mean <em>model</em>; what
these agents do, internally, is much, much simpler than what's usually
meant by PEM.)</p>

<p><b>r-snipes:</b> Agents that don't learn, but produce different types of offspring
that are well suited or poorly suited for survival in different
environments.  These agents implement
one kind of "r-strategy", which roughly prioritize reproduction over
survival.</p>

<p><b>s-snipes:</b> Agents that engage in a simple form of social
learning by copying from nearby agents ("s-snipes"); this implements
another kind of r-strategy.</p>

<p>The point is to compare evolutionary strategies and see which is
selected for under specific parameter combinations.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

Snipes eat mushrooms.  There are two environments.  In the
<em>east</em> (usually left) environment, small mushrooms are
nutritious (gray-brown-green) and large mushrooms are poisonous
(greenish yellow).  In the <em>west</em> (usually right) environment,
large mushrooms are nutritious (dark gray) and small mushrooms are
poisonous (light gray).

<p>Snipes move randomly within an environment, gain energy from eating
nutritious mushrooms, and lose energy from eating poisonous mushrooms.
Snipes that accumulate sufficient energy give birth, and lose energy as
a result of the birth.  At birth, each newborn snipe is placed at a
random location in a randomly chosen environment (as if parents
temporarily migrate to a new location to give birth).</p>

<p><b>k-snipes</b> (red circles with pointers) initially eat
mushrooms randomly,  but learn to eat mushrooms whose size signal
(which is normally distributed) indicates that they are probably
nutritious. The direction of a k-snipe's pointer--how far up or down
its pointing--indicates the degree of the snipe's preference for large
or small mushrooms. </p>

<p><b>r-snipes</b> (blue triangles) never learn.  They produce
offspring that exhibit developmental differences: Roughly half of any
snipe's offspring (upward-pointing triangles) always prefer large
mushrooms; the others (downward-pointing triangles) always prefer
small mushrooms.  Those suited to the environment in which they live
tend to survive and reproduce, and those unsuited to their environment
generally die before reproduction. </p>

<p><b>s-snipes</b> (purple wing shapes) use a social learning or
cultural transmission strategy known as "success bias".  A newborn
s-snipe examines nearby (within <em>NeighborRadius</em>) snipes and
copies the current mushroom size preference of whichever nearby snipe
has the most energy.  If there are no nearby snipes, the s-snipe tries
again on the next timestep.  Once it adopts a preference, an s-snipe's
preference never changes.  The direction in which an s-snipe points--how
far up or down it is tilted--indicates the degree of the snipe's
preference for large or small mushrooms.</p>

<p>Snipes' energy levels are reflected in their brightness, with
greater brightness indicating more energy.  (This effect is rather
subtle.)  Mushroom color indicates nutritiousness/poisonousness: 
Lighter colors indicate nutritiousness--i.e. these mushrooms are
energetically favorable to snipes--while darker colors indicate
poisonousness--energetically unfavorability.  (The difference in hues
between mushrooms in different environments has no functional meaning,
but can be thought of as indicating a difference between mushroom
species.) </p>

<p>If you double-click on a snipe while the run is paused,
it will become circled, and you want watch its internal
states change.</p>

<p>It's possible to display both environments overlapping
in the same window, using the "overlapping subenvs" item
on the Displays tab.  Then you can think of snipes that only
eat mushrooms of a given color as having a random developmental
restriction to eating those mushrooms.</p>

<p>Relative frequencies of the three snipe varieties are reported in the
Model tab, with KSnipeFreq for the frequency of k-snipes, RSnipeFreq for
the frequency of r-snipes, and SSnipeFreq for the frequency of s-snipes.
The population size, including both environments, is reported in
PopSize.  If you click on the little magnifying glass next to these
elements, there are additional options that MASON provides for
observing their values.</p>

<p>You can also run pasta from a command line (see online docs or 
README.md in the full distribution).  In that case, running it with
"--help" will show options for setting these variables before the
simulation starts.  There are also options to allow you to run pasta
without the GUI or to send runtime data to a file.</p>

<p>There is additional information at

<h3>Things to try:</h3>

Set the number of s-snipes (NumSSnipes) or the number of r-snipes
(NumRSnipes) to zero, so that there is only competition between k-snipes
and one of the other varieties.  Notice that with the default
parameters, k-snipes sometimes increase in frequency early on, but in
the end the r-snipes or s-snipes always increase in frequency at the
expense of k-snipes.  Why?  (One way to get insight into this question
is to use the methods described above for watching the internal states
of snipes.  Look, for example, at how the energy level changes over
time in a k-snipe and in an r-snipe.)

<p>Experiment with parameters to see if you can cause k-snipes win the
evolutionary race.  For example, before the start of a k-snipe vs.
r-snipe run, reduce MushNegNutrition.  Does this affects k-snipes'
relative success?  Why?</p>

<p>Pause a run, then double-click on a snipe to monitor its internal state
and watch it move (it will become circled).  You can use the Detach
button to monitor multiple snipes.  Double-click on the little
magnifying glass next to energy, for example, and choose chart.  This
will open a plot of that snipe's energy level over time.  (You can do the
same thing with the snipe frequency variables in the Model tab.)</p>
