Evolutionary competition between different strategies for dealing with
variable environments:

<p><b>k-snipes:</b> Agents that incorporate a very simple model of
individual learning by prediction error minimization (PEM) in some
agents.  These agents implement one kind of "K-strategy" which, roughly,
prioritizes survival over reproduction.  (I do mean <em>model</em>; what
these agents do, internally, is much, much simpler than what's usually
meant by PEM.)</p>

<p><b>r-snipes:</b> Agents that don't learn, but produce different types of offspring
that are well suited or poorly suited for survival in different
environments.  These agents implement
one kind of "r-strategy", which roughly prioritize reproduction over
survival.</p>

<p><b>s-snipes:</b> Agents that engage in a simple form of social
learning by copying from nearby agents ("s-snipes"); this implements
another kind of r-strategy.</p>

<p>The point is to compare evolutionary strategies and see which is
selected for under specific parameter combinations.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

Snipes eat mushrooms.  There are two environments.  In the
<em>east</em> (usually left) environment, small mushrooms are
nutritious (gray-brown-green) and large mushrooms are poisonous
(greenish yellow).  In the <em>west</em> (usually right) environment,
large mushrooms are nutritious (dark gray) and small mushrooms are
poisonous (light gray).

<p>Snipes move randomly within an environment, gain energy from eating
nutritious mushrooms, and lose energy from eating poisonous mushrooms.
Snipes that accumulate sufficient energy give birth, and lose energy as
a result of the birth.  At birth, each newborn snipe is placed at a
random location in a randomly chosen environment (as if parents
temporarily migrate to a new location to give birth).</p>

<p><b>k-snipes</b> (red circles with pointers) initially eat
mushrooms randomly,  but learn to eat mushrooms whose size signal
(which is normally distributed) indicates that they are probably
nutritious. The direction of a k-snipe's pointer--how far up or down
its pointing--indicates the degree of the snipe's preference for large
or small mushrooms. </p>

<p><b>r-snipes</b> (blue triangles) never learn.  They produce
offspring that exhibit developmental differences: Roughly half of any
snipe's offspring (upward-pointing triangles) always prefer large
mushrooms; the others (downward-pointing triangles) always prefer
small mushrooms.  Those suited to the environment in which they live
tend to survive and reproduce, and those unsuited to their environment
generally die before reproduction. </p>

<p><b>s-snipes</b> (purple wing shapes) use a social learning or
cultural transmission strategy known as "success bias".  A newborn
s-snipe examines nearby (within <em>NeighborRadius</em>) snipes and
copies the current mushroom size preference of whichever nearby snipe
has the most energy.  If there are no nearby snipes, the s-snipe tries
again on the next timestep.  Once it adopts a preference, an s-snipe's
preference never changes.  The direction in which an s-snipe points--how
far up or down it is tilted--indicates the degree of the snipe's
preference for large or small mushrooms.</p>

<p>Snipes' energy levels are reflected in their brightness, with
greater brightness indicating more energy.  (This effect is rather
subtle.)  Mushroom color indicates nutritiousness/poisonousness: 
Lighter colors indicate nutritiousness--i.e. these mushrooms are
energetically favorable to snipes--while darker colors indicate
poisonousness--energetically unfavorability.  (The difference in hues
between mushrooms in different environments has no functional meaning,
but can be thought of as indicating a difference between mushroom
species.) </p>

<p>If you double-click on a snipe while the run is paused,
it will become circled, and you want watch it's internal
states change.</p>

<p>It's possible to display both environments overlapping
in the same window, using the "overlapping subenvs" item
on the Displays tab.  Then you can think of snipes that only
eat mushrooms of a given color as having a random developmental
restriction to eating those mushrooms.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>At the moment, there's no documentation of what the sliders and other
settable elements in the Model tab do.  I need to add this.  You will be
able to guess what some of them do.  If you go to the page listed
below, there are notes about how to run pasta on the command line.  If
you do that, you can run it with <em>--help</em> as a parameter.  This
will include further clues as to the meanings of the options in the
Model tab.</p>
