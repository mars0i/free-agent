DONE get rid of bg field portrayal
DONE 2 mush fields
DONE 2 snipe fields
DONE fix popenv to deal with separate fields
	instead just made two popenvs
should children be in both subenvs?
	for this I might need to replace next-popenv
	with a combined next-popenvs
	we have two source subenvs
	and two target subenvs
	and I can either iterate through the potential parents
	subenv by subenv, or somehow interleaving them
fix s-snipe perception
bug: circled portrayals no longer work
fix stats
DONE 2 mush portrayals
DONE 2 snipe portrayals
DONE attach the four portrayals to one display, side by side

attach the four portrayals to the new display, overlaid
think through mentoring
