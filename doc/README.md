Code documentation
====

This directory contains notes on pasta source code.  Some files, such as
kSnipePerception.pdf, would be of interest to people who just want to
experiment with pasta without looking at the source code.  See the
README.md at the root of this repo for general notes about pasta, how to
run it, etc.

* kSnipePerception.pdf: Notes on k-snipes' learning algorithm.

* defsim.md: Documentation on the `defsim` macro in `utils.defsim`.
This is used in Sim.clj and generates code whose effects are used
throughout pasta.

* functionalMASON.md: Notes on strategies for writing in a more
functional-programming style using MASON.

* ClojureMASONinteropTips.md: General notes on Clojure-Java interop
relevant to use of Clojure with MASON.  This document came from my
experiments implementing MASON's Students example in Clojure (see the
<a href="https://github.com/mars0i/majure">majure</a> repo).  This
document reflected my focus at the time on producing code that was as
fast as possible.  After the majure experiments, I applied what I'd
learned in the <a
href="https://github.com/mars0i/intermittran">intermittran</a> repo. 
The resulting code in intermittran is not very idiomatic to Clojure,
and unpleasant, imo.  My current approach is to worry more about
trying to write (relatively) idiomatic Clojure rather than trying to
eke out as much speed from MASON as possible, but the interopTips
document provides the background for my approach in pasta, including
the `defsim` macro.

* Notes on variable naming: Variables that contain atoms have "$" at
the end of their names. This is nonstandard; the norm is to give atom
variables normal names. Sometimes it's convenient to have both a
variable containing and atom and one containing a dereferenced version
of the same data.  A naming convention makes it clear which is which.
Using a suffix that is not "@" (an obvious choice) seems easiest to
read.  I sometimes use camel case to name things that have a Java-ey
role with MASON, but mostly use Clojure-standard kebab case.
