Data that I might want to record per-tick or on designated ticks

k-snipe, s-snipe, r-snipe counts
	overall
	per positive/negative pref
	per subenv
summary stats, per all of the categories above, for live snipes'
	age
	energy
	prefs
summary stats, per all of the categories above, for dead snipes'
	age
	prefs ?
	(not energy--it's zero)

no need:
frequencies (since can be calculated from counts)
