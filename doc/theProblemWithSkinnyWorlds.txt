This is how I described the problem at the time
(https://github.com/mars0i/pasta/issues/37):

	There is one thing that's unrealistic about short worlds. When
	pop size is low, snipes going up or down come back to the same
	region, so that nutritious mushrooms in that region all get
	eaten up. They're not soon replaced because, since pop size is
	small, there aren't a lot of snipes eating elsewhere. I don't
	know whether this is the cause of this issue, but it suggests
	that very short or very narrow worlds should simply be avoided;
	they are incapable of being treated realistically without a
	revision of mushroom restoration.

The additional point one needs to know is that the number of mushrooms
is constant: When a mushroom is eaten, another mushroom appears in a
random location.  That means that if there are a lot of snipes eating in
one area, you end up losing mushrooms in that area, and get new
mushrooms that are usually somewhere else.  When the worlds
(environments) are neither narrow nor wide, this isn't a problem because
snipes move around a lot.  When the world is skinny, though, snipes end
up staying in the same region more than with a non-skinny world, because
when they go off the edge of the environment, they come back on the
other side opposite that point.  (I could change this, but there are
both programming and modeling drawbacks.)


The solution: Don't use skinny worlds.
