Branch before-Feb2019-type-hint-additions:
branched off from master at 90bdbd8, which was just before
I started adding various type hints (starting with some in
defsim.clj).

(I created a branch because I needed to make a change to allow
setting seeds on the command line for the sake of time trials.)
