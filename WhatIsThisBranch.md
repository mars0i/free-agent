This is a branch on which I'm storing some modified files from the free
repo.  I had originally thought I'd use the free framework in free-energy,
but at this point I'm not.  Nevertheless, there are some useful modifications
such as renaming to more intuitive names rather than Bogacz's variable
names, which I want to store.  However, these files are no longer part
of what I'm doing in free-energy at present.
